> What is a pixel?

> All images consist of pixels which are the raw building blocks of images. 
> Images are made of pixels in a grid. 
> A 640 x 480 image has 640 columns (the width) and 480 rows (the height). 
> There are 640 * 480 = 307200  pixels in an image with those dimensions.

> Each value in the BGR 3-tuple has a range of [0, 255]. 
> How many color possibilities are there for each pixel in an RGB image in OpenCV? 
> Thatâ€™s easy: 256 * 256 * 256 = 16777216
